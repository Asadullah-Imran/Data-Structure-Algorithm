# Insertion Sort

=> Insertion sort is a sorting technique where we insert a number in a array or collections.

Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.




## Time Complexity
Case Time Complexity
- Best Case
O(n)
- Average Case
O(n2)
- Worst Case
O(n2)

1. **Best Case Complexity** - It occurs when there is no sorting required, i.e. the array is already sorted. The best-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n).
2. **Average Case Complexity** - It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending. The average case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n2).
3. **Worst Case Complexity** - It occurs when the array elements are required to be sorted in reverse order. That means suppose you have to sort the array elements in ascending order, but its elements are in descending order. The worst-case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n2).
